## From Trade School to Two Careers: A Journey of Making Things

I grew up going to a trade high school where you could get your hands on just about anything — photography, auto, computers, screen printing. That's where I first realized I liked making things, not just studying them. When graduation came around, everyone talked about taking big post-school trips. I skipped Europe and bought a Canon DSLR instead. Best decision I ever made.

## The Camera That Changed Everything

That camera pushed me farther than I expected. It took me to Japan and South Korea for seasonal photography work — a few weeks to a few months at a time, for three consecutive years. I worked as Head Destination Photographer at Campus Photography International across U.S. military bases, leading photography operations and building client relationships in diverse, challenging environments.

I was in Japan during the tsunami, and life had a way of hitting pause after that. I told myself I'd take a single year off. That year stretched into several, and I drifted into all kinds of work: retail, breweries, warehouses, construction — the whole "find your footing" era.

## Finding Code in the Chaos

Somewhere in that mix, while I was unemployed during the pandemic in 2020, I picked up a new hobby: messing with basic HTML and automation. I had no idea it would open the door to a whole different world. I started creating automations for social media and Discord channels, just to see if I could. One line of code turned into hours of curiosity, and suddenly I wasn't just clicking around — I was actually building things.

Then I discovered AI — not the hype version, but the "this can teach me" version. It flipped everything.

## The Self-Taught Path

I started exploring more languages, tools, and frameworks until a few finally stuck. I got comfortable reading and writing code. I learned how to connect API keys, build my own tools, and teach AI systems how to support customers, creators, or even myself. Visual Studio Code became my new creative workspace, the same way my camera had been years before.

The same spark that photography gave me years ago came back, but now it was expanded — a blend of visuals, creativity, and problem-solving.

## ChrisOCPhoto → ChrisOC Digital

What started as **ChrisOCPhoto** in 2007 evolved into something bigger. The photography business that began with event coverage and portraits grew into **ChrisOC Digital** — a full-service creative studio that bridges visual storytelling with modern web development.

ChrisOCPhoto remains an active division, still serving clients with the same dedication to quality that defined its founding. But now it sits alongside a web development practice where I build responsive, user-friendly applications using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and AI integration.

## A Portfolio of Projects

Today, I'm back where it all started: creating. Photography is still part of my identity, but now it lives alongside development, design, and building AI-powered experiences. I like projects that have purpose, that make something easier, better, or more meaningful — whether that's capturing a moment through a lens or writing the logic that powers a product.

My project portfolio includes:
- **ChrisOCPhoto** - Professional photography portfolio with elegant galleries
- **CookbookVerse** - Recipe discovery and sharing platform
- **GetEditly** - AI-powered photo editor with smart enhancements
- **PlanAI** - AI planning assistant for task organization
- **URBNWX** - Real-time weather application
- **UltimateNotes** - All-in-one digital journal
- **Munch** - Modern healthy snack company website
- And several others — a mix of active projects, shelved experiments, and contracted work

Each one represents a different challenge, a different skill learned, a different problem solved.

## The Blend

This portfolio is the result of both journeys — the creative one and the technical one — finally catching up to each other. I bring a unique perspective: the eye of a photographer who understands composition and storytelling, combined with the mindset of a developer who can build the systems to deliver it.

Whether you need stunning visuals for your brand or a custom web platform to showcase your work, ChrisOC Digital delivers end-to-end creative solutions — from concept to execution, across both photography and digital development.

## Why This Story Matters

If you're reading this and thinking *"I've been stuck in jobs that don't fit"* or *"I learned something once but never went back to it"* or *"I don't know if I'm a creative or a technical person"* — I get it.

You don't have to pick one path and stick with it forever. Skills can hibernate and come back stronger. A camera can lead to code. Construction work can teach you problem-solving. Unemployment can spark the curiosity that changes everything.

The thing is: **makers keep making**, no matter what form it takes. Sometimes it's a photograph. Sometimes it's a website. Sometimes it's an AI chatbot that helps visitors navigate a portfolio.

Whatever it is — just keep building.
