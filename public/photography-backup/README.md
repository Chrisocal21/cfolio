# Photography Gallery Images

Add your photography images to this folder to display in the gallery.

## File Naming
Name your images sequentially or descriptively:
- `photo-1.jpg`, `photo-2.jpg`, etc.
- Or use descriptive names: `sunset-landscape.jpg`, `portrait-studio.jpg`

## Image Specifications
- **Format**: JPG or PNG (JPG recommended for photos)
- **Size**: 1920x1080px or similar 16:9 aspect ratio recommended
- **Optimization**: Compress to 200-500KB per image for fast loading
- **Orientation**: Both landscape and portrait supported

## Current Setup
The photography page is configured for 12 images by default. You can:
- Add 12 images to fill the grid
- Add more or fewer - the page will be updated accordingly
- Update the alt text in `src/app/photography/page.tsx` to describe each photo

## Example File Names
```
photo-1.jpg
photo-2.jpg
photo-3.jpg
...
photo-12.jpg
```

Once you add images here, update the photography page to reference them instead of the placeholder gradients.
